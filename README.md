# Yossef Mendelssohn's vim config

Yup, I use vim. I'm hip.

## Installation

Clone and go

    $ git clone https://github.com/ymendel/dotvim.git ~/.vim
    $ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    $ cd ~/.vim && git submodule update --init
    $ vim -u vundle +BundleInstall +qall

## Appreciation

  - Ben Bleything (@bleything), not least because this started off as a fork of his [dotvim repo][bleyvim].
  - Mike Skalnik (@skalnik), for inspiring me to actually make this my own instead of making very minor
  modifications to some else's config. And his [dotvim repo][skalvim] has also been helpful.
